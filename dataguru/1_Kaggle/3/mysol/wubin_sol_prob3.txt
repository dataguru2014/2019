After exploring

events.csv, I found:
  Among all events(around 3 million), there are around 1/50 of this number of unique device_id, which is around 60 thousand unique device_id.
  After this, I can gather all information for each single device:

# First, let's find how many devices in total.
events = pd.read_csv("events.csv")
device_id_unique=pd.Series(events.device_id.unique())
m = device_id_unique.shape[0] # m is 60865, so 60865 unique device_id

empty_set = []
for n in range(m):
    empty_set.append(events.loc[events.device_id==device_id_unique[n]])

# but the above 4 lines may run several minutes; to keep quick, change m = 100, then run, it should take within seconds.


# After some trial and run, here's more code about: add a feature relating to each phone brand, of "gender" that may help visualize the gender distribution among different brands.

gender_age_train = pd.read_csv("gender_age_train.csv")
gender_age_test = pd.read_csv("gender_age_test.csv")
phone_brand_device_model = pd.read_csv("phone_brand_device_model.csv")
events = pd.read_csv("events.csv")
app_events = pd.read_csv("app_events.csv")
app_labels = pd.read_csv("app_labels.csv")
label_categories = pd.read_csv("label_categories.csv")
for i in dir():
    try:
        print(i,eval(i).shape,eval(i).columns)
    except BaseException:
        pass

p = phone_brand_device_model
gtr = gender_age_train
gte = gender_age_test
for i in range(gtr.shape[0]):
    p.loc[p['device_id']==gtr.device_id[i],'gender']=gtr.gender[i]
    print('running: ',i)

dict_brand = dict()
for i in range(p.shape[0]):
    print('dictionary: ',i)
    new_key = p.phone_brand[i]
    if p.phone_brand[i] not in dict_brand.keys():
        dict_brand[new_key] = dict()
        dict_brand[new_key]['M']=0
        dict_brand[new_key]['F']=0
    else:
        if p.gender[i] == 'M':
            dict_brand[new_key]['M']+=1
        if p.gender[i]== 'F':
            dict_brand[new_key]['F']+=1

'''for j in range(phone_brand_device_model.device_id.shape[0]):

        print(init)
        if phone_brand_device_model.device_id.iloc[j] == i:
            temp = phone_brand_device_model.iloc[j].name
            to_drop.append(temp)
    phone_brand_device_model.drop(to_drop,inplace=True)
