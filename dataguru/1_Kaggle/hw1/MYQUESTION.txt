1. In the clean_text function in the code nlp_utils.py in Feat directory, what does the following code mean?

        ## replace gb
        for vol in [16, 32, 64, 128, 500]:
            l = re.sub("%d gb"%vol, "%dgb"%vol, l)
            l = re.sub("%d g"%vol, "%dgb"%vol, l)
            l = re.sub("%dg "%vol, "%dgb "%vol, l)
        ## replace tb
        for vol in [2]:        
            l = re.sub("%d tb"%vol, "%dtb"%vol, l)
2. My desktop computer, bought in 2015, has problem running tensorflow, while my 2012 ThinkPad has no problem running tensorflow, using same installation approach, why is that? When running/importing tensorflow, the error is:

Using TensorFlow backend.
2019-06-09 10:13:50.353455: F tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:37] The TensorFlow library was compiled to use SSE4.2 instructions, but these aren't available on your machine.
Aborted (core dumped)

Any way to fix this??

My desktop computer's cpu information is as follows:

3. In the code preprocess.py in the /Code/Feat directory, grammatically, how to understand the following?
4
## one-hot encode the median_relevance
for i in range(config.n_classes):
    dfTrain["median_relevance_%d" % (i+1)] = 0
    dfTrain["median_relevance_%d" % (i+1)][dfTrain["median_relevance"]==(i+1)] = 1

4. Same directory as above, how to understanda the following, I known lambda expression, but I am confused with the following?

## insert query id
dfTrain["qid"] = map(lambda q: qid_dict[q], dfTrain["query"])
dfTest["qid"] = map(lambda q: qid_dict[q], dfTest["query"])

5. In section 2.2.1 of the author's paper, how did the author apply spelling corrections, as listed in table 1? Is this done by human? It looks like the text data is too large for human detection.

Table 1: Spelling Correction

6. Similar to the above question, what does the synonym replacement and other replacement? I have found a 50-lin .csv file in the Data folder for using synonym replacer, but I don;t how how it came along:

'girls,girl
girl's,girl
girls',girl
girls,girl
girlz,girl
boy's,boy
boys',boy
boys,boy
men's,man

In the nlp_utils.py file, the author metioned that there's a replace dict for synonym replacer, by exploring the training data, but how?

replace_dict = {
