1. how to write an nn, using Keras, to represent any simple function?
2. how does ImageDataGenerator in keras.preprocessing.image work? i.e., how does it yield batches indefinitely given data? Further, how to write MY OWN GENERATOR THAT yield batches of data? how does the __getitem__ work?
3. about feature engineering: to decide whether a feature is relevant to a target or not, some methods are available: using df.corr(), using df.groupby('key')['key2'].mean() or .median(), etc., visualize relation between feature and target. Are there any other methods? In addition, does there exist a correlation value that represents a threshold in df.corr(), say, +- 0.001 or something? What are some good grouby method and visualization method, specifically in python?
4. about feature engineering:: how to systematically know that a specific feature engineering will make the model better? For example, one may have one hundred lines of code, with each line representing a specific computation of feature engineering, e.g. fillna, encoding categorical to ordinal, create a new feature, etc. There may be a lot of lines about feature engineering, so the question is, how to SYSTEMATICALLY know that this line will improve the model's performance?
