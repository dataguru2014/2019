part 1:

0. The ZEROTH RULE: THINK OF THE KART AS A THREE WHEEL VEHICLE WHEN TURNING, UNLIKE A FOUR WEEHL CAR.

1. Understeer is bad, while it may seem superflucial to explain, the reason is the secret of karting, which took me a long time pondering on. Why? The kart is designed to operate as a three-wheeled vehicle and only turns well when it is loaded three-wheel. Most experienced karters know, because of the SOLID AXLE, the INSIDE REAR must UNLOAD for better turn, or it drags on the groud, which leads to underteer and not turn very well.

2. To explain why four-wheeled load will cause understeer: the most crucial concept is PATH DIFFERENCE inside and outside wheel takes. For the front wheel, they have no problem - since they are INDEPENDENT and free to rotate. But rear wheels are stuck TOGETHER and MUST ROTATE at EXCATLY the SAME speed. THIS SETUP will physically cause the problem the driver does not want: if the rear wheels are both planted on the ground, the inside rear will rotate faster than it can, and thus making the kart to turn less angle, which means pushing the INSIDE OF the kart into a more straight line, decreasing the angle of turning, WHICH IS BAD.

3. However, unlike car, which uses differential, fitting a differential to a kart will be expensive, against the rules, and would TOTALLY CHANGE EVERYTHING ABOUT KARTING. So the solution instead is: MAKE THE KART USE ONLY THE OUTER REAR TIRE WHILE CORNERING. THIS IS ALSO WHY THE SIZE OF THE REAR TIRE IS MUCH THAN THE FRONT - to balance out the grip from the front tires.

4. PRINCIPLES: IN A KART, THE FUNCTION AND PURPOSE OF TURNING THE WHEEL IS FAR BEYOND CONTROLING THE DIRECTION OF THE KART. When you turn, the front outside tire will go up, and the front inside tire will go down: only three tires can be resting evenly on the ground by now.

5. THE JACKING EFFECT: the phenomenon of liting the tire on a kart, as if you had taken a JACK????? and lift the kart.

6. The physical structure of the kart makes the front more "soft" and the rear more "stiff". The "waist" of the kart softens the front and the extra frame and big axle stiffens the rear.

7. Your position will affect the Center of Gravity. When turn left, you can lean forward right, make better use of the outer & front.

8. Your basic goal is to have the rear inside unload just enough so that it is not pressing into the ground and no more.
